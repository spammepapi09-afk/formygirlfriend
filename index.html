            <p>Hi Andrea, im loving the time im spending with you every day feels like a new day with you and i love that. sometimes i like to reflect on how lucky i was to match with you and how playing a stupid game with some friends for some followers turned into the best decision of my life and a 5 month relationship (half a year after your birthday definitely wasnt intentional from past kaleb 😜). ive loved and enjoyed every day so far with you, the ups and downs because that lets me know were growing as a couple and i cant wait to see this through with you. youre an amazing smart young woman andrea and i wouldnt want to spend my life with anyone else. i truly dont want to experience my life with anyone else, im so lucky to have you. most times i forget the distance is there, only really feeling it when i want to hold you in my arms and show love. i cant wait to get this degree so i can come over there and really start my life with you! </p>

            <p>Meow, Hi pretty girl originally this was for some more love stuff but im editing this after you dumped how you felt abt your body to me and i dont know all your body but i know every time i see or talk to you i know im talking/seeing one of the most beautiful girls in the world hands down. i love all the little things about you but this note is specifically talking about your body/temple. you asked me what abt other girls and yeah what about them? i dont want to acknowledge any other girl other than my future wife. when you were screensharing and multiple girls asses were showing i looked away and to some people that might be overreacting but i like to know i can do that not only for myself but for you too. youre the only girl im attracted to, i have no eyes for anyone else. i love your feet, legs, stomach, butt, chest, arms, smile, face, hair, all of it, its all perfect to me. theres truly not one thing id change. even that big brain and heart inside of you always brings a smile to my face. i could go on for hours, id remind you every day of how bea2ful you are. i know its normal to envy/compare yourself to others but when you do i get mad because all i see in you is the divine definition of perfect!</p>

            <p>Hiiii marmalade, do you remember this song? ive listened to it 12 times since youve ever mentioned it to me, 10 of those being the same week of you saying it. i never forgot it, always kept it in my head, i wanted to know why you liked it :). anyways this is the last of the notes, im not really good at writing these types of things, i express more face to face. if you want a sense of where my head is, im tearing up rn at 4am writing this. i love you marmalade, youre the best thing that has happened in my life. ive never regretted a single day with you in these 5 months and 31 days of knowing you. im glad i stayed true to myself and kept texting you in the early days, i would do it all again to feel that love, to feel THIS love. every call, text, voice message, picture, and video was special to me. every little inside joke. ive never felt this close to someone which is ironic for someone so far, but that distance feels like 10 seconds with you. these past few months have gone by in a blink of an eye and thats because of your amazing enthusiasm that i needed. youre my motivation, my breath, and you carry all the love in my heart. although were far i wouldnt change one thing because i know all of this is for a reason, and i pray that as the days go by we become closer and closer to death due us part. since 6.17.25 my life has only gone up. i love you more than the words out my mouth or letters on this note could ever represent. i cant wait for all of our future moments together and to spend the rest of my life with you Andrea. youve changed my life in ways youll never know and ill forever be grateful for that. no matter how many miles in between us, my heart will be with you and forever yours. Love your cookie, Kaleb.</p>
